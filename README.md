# Podcast Organizer

Take an ompl file from a podcast app (like iCatcher) and organize all the subscriptions.

This tool will get all rss feeds from an ompl file and pull the podcast information and format it into a nice markdown file. For example the podcast How I AI from the ompl file should have output that looks like this.

Short Example

Source:

```
<outline type="rss" text="How%20I%20AI" title="How%20I%20AI" xmlUrl="https://anchor.fm/s/1035b1568/podcast/rss"  <kbd></kbd>

```

Desired Output:

# AI Podcasts

Title: How I AI
Link: [rss](https://anchor.fm/s/1035b1568/podcast/rss)
YouTube Link: [How I AI - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@howiaipodcast)

To create this there will be several steps.

Step 1: get RSS feed info
Step 2: turn into markdown formatted file
Step 3: Enrich with tags and other info using AI

# Step 1: get RSS feed info

Read the OMPL file and for each outline  entry pull out the text, title, and url.

Example entry.
```
<outline type="rss" text="How%20I%20AI" title="How%20I%20AI" xmlUrl="https://anchor.fm/s/1035b1568/podcast/rss"  <kbd></kbd>
```

For each rss url get the content of the url via curl or similar. It should be a well formatted rss xml feed. In the <channel> section of the feed you can pull all the podcast details. 

# Step 2: turn into markdown formatted file

Take all the rss feeds and pullFrom that section pull the following and put into the final podcast list file.  The info to pull includes

- title
- link
- description

# Step 3: Enrich with tags and other info using AI

Use AI to organize the podcasts into a markdown file formatted as follows.

## Podcasts organizer prompt

Read my OMPL list of my subscribers podcasts and create a markdown file appropriate for obsidian containing all my podcasts categorized by major theme.

For each entry include the podcast name, podcast url, and a series of tags.

For each look up better reference links for each podcast. Ideally find a link to the YouTube version of the podcast as well. Add a short description of the podcast as well which you might get from YouTube or another site.

  Short Example

Source:

```
<outline type="rss" text="How%20I%20AI" title="How%20I%20AI" xmlUrl="https://anchor.fm/s/1035b1568/podcast/rss"  <kbd></kbd>

```
